# Excel-Smash-Results
This sheet is designed to store data for fighting game tournaments, initially built for Super Smash Bros.  This is meant to keep track of a season's worth of data, storing it for further analysis.  Participation, rank, and individual rounds are all tracked in order to craft summary sheets for how players performed in each tournament, and throughout the whole season.  This sheet also holds VBA for connecting to Challonge's API and quickly gathering results.

# VBA Code
All of the advanced processes was handled through progamming with Visual Basic for Applications.  This code can be found within the Excel workbook itself upon downloading the XLSB file in the repository.

# Future Plans
At the moment this sheet connects to Challonge's API.  I intend to do the same with Smash GG's API, as that service is more popular, but it is moving to a GraphQL API, which I am not familiar with.  This will be integrated in the future.
